# LGBench

> An encoding oriented semantic validation benchmark.

This repo is mainly used for semantic encoding validation for short CJK texts (SemVal-S). And StruVal-C can be found at [Janus](https://github.com/SWUFE-DB-Group/Janus).

## How to Use for Semantic Validation

1. First download a Qwen family model (recommended: [Qwen3-0.6B](https://modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B) or [Qwen2.5-0.5B](https://modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B) on [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/my/overview)):
   ```
   modelscope download --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --local_dir ./your_dir
   # or
   modelscope download --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B --local_dir ./your_dir
   ```
